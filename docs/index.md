I am a computer science student residing in California, focusing on trading infrastructure and operating systems. I hold an interest in political science, law (immigration, patent, contract), and financial market microstructure. To organize and reinforce the information I acquire, I maintain thorough notes, some of which are shared with the public.

I completed an internship at a fintech startup and will soon join a quantitative trading firm. Feel free to connect me on LinkedIn to discuss career matters or other related topics.
