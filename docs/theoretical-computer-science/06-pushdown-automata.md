# Pushdown Automata

The **pushdown automata** is a finite state machine with a stack that could remember an infinite amount of information. The transition in the pushdown automata is consists of the input symbol to read or $\epsilon$, the symbol to pop from the stack or $\epsilon$, and the symbol to push to the stack or $\epsilon$.
