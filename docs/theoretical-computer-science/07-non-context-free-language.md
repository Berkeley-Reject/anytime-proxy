# Non-Context-Free Language

The language $L$ is context-free if it is generated by a context free grammar.

## Pumping Lemma for Context-Free Language

Let $L$ be context-free. There exists a $P \in N$ such that for all $s \in L$ of length $|s| \geq P$ could be decomposed as $s = uvxyz$ where $|vxy| \leq P$, $|v| + |y| \neq 0$, and $uv^i xy^i z \in L$ for all $i = 0, 1, \dots$.

Let $(V, \Sigma, R, S)$ be a context-free grammar for $L$. Let $b$ be the maximum length of all rules in $R$, which is the maximum branching factor of the grammar tree. Let $P = b^{|V| + 1}$ and $s$ be a string in $L$ such that $|s| \geq P$. Let $n$ be the number of leaves in the smallest (fewest nodes) grammar tree of $s$ and $h$ be the height of the smallest grammar tree of $s$, then $b \leq |s| \leq n \leq b^{h}$ and $n \geq |V| + 1$. Therefore, there's a pair of variables in the grammar tree that occurs at least twice.

## Contrapositive Form of Pumping Lemma

Let $L$ be non-context-free. **For all** $P \in N$ such that **there exists** an $s \in L$ of length $|s| \geq P$, **for all** $s = uvxyz$ where $|vxy| \leq P$, $|v| + |y| \neq 0$, **there exists** an $i$ such that $uv^i xy^i z \notin L$.

## Example

- Let $L = \{ a^n b^n a^n: n \geq 0 \}$. For all $P$, there exists an $s = a^P b^P a^P$. For all $s = uvxyz$, $uxz \notin L$. Therefore, $L$ is non-context-free.
- Let $L = \{ w \in \{ a, b, c \}^*: w \text{ contains equal number of } a, b, c \}$. For all $P$, there exists an $s = a^P b^P c^P$. For all $s = uvxyz$, $uxz \notin L$.
