# Introduction

## Exchange-Traded Market

A derivatives exchange is a market where individuals and companies trade standardized contracts defined by the exchange. The exchange clearing house stands between the two parties to the derivatives transaction so that one party does not have to bear the risk that the other party will default. The electronic trading has replaced the trading floor.

## Over-The-Counter Market

Some trades take place in the over-the-counter market. Banks, other large financial institutions, fund managers, and corporations are the main participants in OTC derivatives markets. Once an OTC trade has been agreed, the two parties can either present it to a central counterparty (CCP) or clear the trade bilaterally. Large banks often act as market makers for some traded instruments. The banks quote a bid price and an ask price.

The volume of business in the over-the-counter market is much larger than in the exchange-traded market. The over-the-counter market is subject to regulations that aims to reduce systemic risk.

- Standardized OTC derivatives between two financial institutions in the United States must be traded on what are referred to a swap execution facilities, which is similar to an exchange.
- There is a requirement in most parts of the world that a CCP be used for most standardized derivatives transactions between financial institutions.
- All trades must be reported to central repositories.

## Forward Contract

Forward contract is an agreement to buy or sell an asset at a certain future time for a certain price. It's traded in the over-the-counter market, which involves financial instuititions and their clients.

- One of the parties to a forward contract assumes a long position and agrees to buy the underlying asset on a certain specified future date for a certain specified price.
- The other party assumes a short position and agrees to sell the asset on the same date for the same price.

The payoff from a long position in a forward contract on one unit of an asset is $S_T - K$, where $K$ is the delivery price and $S_T$ is the spot price of the asset at maturity of the contract. The payoff from a short position is $K - S_T$. The payoff from the contract is also the trader's total gain or loss from the contract.

## Futures Contract

Futures contract is an agreement between two parties to buy or sell an asset at a certain time in the future for certain price. Futures contracts are traded on an exchange. The underlying assets could be commodities or financial assets. The price of the futures follows the laws of supply and demand. If more traders want to go long than to go short, the price goes up. If the reverse is true, then the price goes down.

## Options

Options are traded both on exchanges and in the over-the-counter market. The price in the contract is known as the exercise price or strike price. The date in the contract is the expiration date. American options can be exercised at any time up to the expiration date. European options can be exercised only on the expiration date itself. There are two types of options.

- The call option gives the holder the right to buy 100 shares of the underlying asset by a certain date for a certain price.
- The put option gives the holder the right to sell 100 shares of the underlying asset by a certain date for a certain price.

The options holder does not have to exercise the right. This is what distinguishes options from forwards and futures, where the holder is obligated to buy or sell the underlying asset. Whereas it costs nothing to enter into a forward or futures contract, there is a cost to acquiring an option.

- The price of a call option decreases as the strike price increases, while the price of a put option increases as the strike price increases.
- Both types of option tend to become more valuable as their time to maturity increases.

## Types of Traders

The derivatives market has attracted multiple types of traders and have a great deal of liquidity. When a trader wants to take one side of a contract, there's no problem in finding someone who will take the other side.

- Hedger uses derivatives to reduce the risk from potential future movements in a market variable. There is no guarantee that the outcome with hedging will be better than the outcome without hedging.
  - Hedging using forward contracts fixes the price that the hedger will pay or receive for the underlying asset.
  - Hedging using options provides insurance, which involves the payment of an up-front fee.
- Speculator uses derivatives to bet on the future direction of a market variable.
  - Speculation using forward contracts allows the speculator to obtain leverage with the margin deposit.
  - Speculation using options limits the loss of the speculator to the amount paid for the options.
- Arbitrager takes offsetting positions in two or more instruments to lock in a riskless profit.
