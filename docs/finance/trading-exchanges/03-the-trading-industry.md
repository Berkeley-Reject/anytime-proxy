# The Trading Industry

## Overview

In the trading industry, participants are often categorized as either buy side or sell side. The buy side refers to institutions that buy and hold securities for investment purposes, while the sell side comprises firms that facilitate trading and provide related services.

### Buy Side

- Includes institutional investors such as mutual funds, pension funds, insurance companies, and hedge funds
- Focuses on investment research, portfolio management, and risk management
- Aims to generate returns for clients or the firm itself
- Examples of buy-side roles: Portfolio manager, research analyst, and risk manager

### Sell Side

- Represents the supply side of the market
- Includes investment banks, broker-dealers, market makers, and exchanges
- Facilitates trading by providing services like underwriting, market-making, and brokerage
- Generates revenue through fees, commissions, and trading profits
- Examples of sell-side roles: Investment banker, sales and trading professional, and research analyst

## Participants

### Traders

Traders are individuals and institutions that buy and sell securities. They engage in various trading strategies, such as value investing, growth investing, and arbitrage.

- Traders have long positions when they own something.
- Traders have short positions when they have sold something that they don't own.

#### Categories

- Retail traders: Individual investors trading their own funds
- Institutional traders: Employees of institutions like mutual funds, pension funds, and hedge funds
- Proprietary traders: Trade with a firm's capital to earn profits for the firm

### Exchanges

Exchanges provide a centralized marketplace for trading securities and stablish rules and regulations to govern trading activities. Some exchanges have order-driven trading systems that match buy and sell orders to arrange trades.

### Clearinghouses

The clearing agent matches the buyer and seller records and confirms that both traders agreed to the same terms. A trade clears if the buyer and seller both report that they traded with each other, and their reported terms of trade are identical.

The settlement agent receives cash from buyers and securities from sellers. When both sides have performed, the settlement agent gives the cash to the seller and the securities to the buyer. The settlement process is efficient because of net settlement.

The clearinghouses clear and settle all trades in the derivative contracts and guarantee that both parties will perform on their contracts. The clearinghouses are the issuers and guarantors of the contracts.

Clearinghouses are owned by clearing members, who are responsible for settling all trades. Traders who are not clearing members must have a clearing member guarantee the settlement of their trades. If a trader fails to settle a trade, his clearing member must do so. If a clearing member fails to settle a trade, the clearing-house can tax its other members to settle the trade.

### Depositories and Custodians

Depositories and custodians hold cash and securities on behalf of their clients. They help settle trades by quickly delivering cash and security certificates—when properly instructed—to settlement agents. Depositories and custodians also help ensure the security of their clients' assets.

## Trading Instruments

- Real assets include physical commodities, real estate, machines, patents, and other intellectual properties.

- Financial assets are instruments that represent ownership of real assets and the cash flows that they produce. Stocks and bonds are financial assets because they represent ownership of the assets of a corporation. Issuers, such as corporations or governments, create all financial assets. Issues trade in primary markets when issuers first create and sell them. Subsequent trading occurs in secondary markets. Primary trading in new equity issues takes place in the initial public offering market.

### Equities

Stocks represent ownership of corporate assets, net of corporate liabilities. Stock values depend on corporate assets, liabilities, and income.

- Preferred stocks are stocks that pay dividends at contractually specified rates.
- American depository receipts (ADRs) are trust units that traders use to trade foreign stocks in U.S. markets. Each trust holds only the stock of a single foreign company.
- Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are mutual funds that trade at exchanges.
- Real estate investment trusts (REITs) are trusts that own real estate.

### Debt Instruments

Debt instruments are known as fixed-income products. Bonds are debt securities issued by corporations, governments, and individuals. Bond values depend on interest rates, issuer creditworthiness, assets pledged as collateral, and attached options.

- Straight bonds are bonds that pay interest periodically until it matures. At maturity, the issuers redeem the bonds for their principal or face value.
- Treasury bills, Treasury notes, and Treasury bonds are debt securities issued by a country. Bills normally mature in one year or less. Notes normally mature two to five years after they are issued, and bonds normally mature ten or more years after they are issued.
- Zero coupon bonds pay no interest. They simply return their principal value at maturity. Since they pay no interest, buyers will buy them only at a discount from their face value.
- Mortgage-backed securities are bondlike instruments which receive the mortgage payments that borrowers make on their mortgages.
- Collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs) are mortgage-backed securities that divide rights to the cash flows from the mortgage pool into several different tranches. Each tranche has different rights to the payments that the mortgage borrowers make.

### Derivative Contracts

Derivative contracts are instruments that derive their values from the values of the underlying instruments. They are contractual agreements between buyers and sellers that specify the exchange of certain privileges and liabilities.

- Forward contracts are contracts for the future sale of some commodity. The commodity may be a physical commodity, like pork bellies, or a financial commodity, like a currency.
- Standardized futures contracts are forward contracts that an exchange clearinghouse guarantees.
- Option contracts give their holders the option to buy or sell an underlying instrument at a fixed price.
  - A call option is an option to buy at a fixed strike price.
  - A put option is an option to sell at a fixed strike price.
- Swaps are contracts for the exchange of two future cash flows. A cash flow is a series of payments.
  - An interest rate swap provides for the exchange of a future series of fixed-rate interest payments for a future series of variable floating-rate interest payments.
  - A currency swap provides for the exchange of a future series of fixed payments in one currency for a future series of payments in another currency.
