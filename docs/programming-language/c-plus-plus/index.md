# C++ Programming Language

C++ program is a sequence of text files (header and source files) that contain declarations. These files undergo translation to become an executable program, which is executed when the C++ implementation calls its main function.

The entities of a C++ program are values, objects, references, structured bindings, functions, enumerators, types, class members, templates, template specializations, parameter packs, and namespaces.

Declarations could introduce entities, associate them with names and define their properties. The declarations that define all properties required to use entities are definitions. Each program must contain a unique definition of a non-inline function or variable that is odr-used. Definitions of functions include sequences of statements, some of which include expressions.

Names encountered in a program are associated with the declarations that introduced them using name lookup. Each name is valid within a part of the program called its scope. Some name has linkage which makes it refer to the same entities when it appears in different scopes or translation units.

Each object, reference, function, expression in C++ is associated with a type, which could be fundamental, compound, or user-defined, complete or incomplete, etc.
