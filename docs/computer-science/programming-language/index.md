## Programming Paradigm

- Imperative programming is a programming paradigm that focuses on describing how a program operates by giving step-by-step instructions for the computer to follow. It is based on the idea of changing program state by executing statements that alter the program's state. In imperative programming, the programmer specifies the algorithms and control flow directly in terms of statements, loops, and conditionals.

- Functional programming is a programming paradigm that emphasizes the use of lambda functions to perform computation. In functional programming, the focus is on declaring what the program should do, rather than how it should do it. Functions are treated as first-class citizens and can be passed as arguments to other functions or returned as values from functions. In functional programming, the state is kept immutable, which means that once a value is assigned, it cannot be changed.
