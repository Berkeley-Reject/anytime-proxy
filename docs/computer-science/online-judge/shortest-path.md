# Shortest Path

- [Floyd-Warshall algorithm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OQeCuLYj-4): Shortest path between all pairs of vertices, negative edges allowed.
- [Bellman-Ford algorithm](https://oi-wiki.org/graph/shortest-path/#bellman-ford): Shortest path from one node to all nodes, negative edges allowed.
- Dijkstra's algorithm: Shortest path from one node to all nodes.
