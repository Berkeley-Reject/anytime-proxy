# Introduction

> We think we are creating the system for our own purposes. We believe we are making it in our own image... But the computer is not really like us. It is a projection of a very slim part of ourselves: that portion devoted to logic, order, rule, and clarity.

This notebook is a collection of the notes I kept for the courses and documentations I learned in my Computer Science degree at UCLA. The notebook includes various topics (Web Development, Software Engineering, etc.), but these notes are by no means intended to be comprehensive. That being said, I will keep updating it until I graduate or leave this industry.
