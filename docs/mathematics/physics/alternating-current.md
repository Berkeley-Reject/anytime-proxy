# Alternating Current

The AC circuit is a circuit with varying voltages and currents. To supply an alternating current to a circuit, a source of alternating emf or voltage is required. The term ac source refers to a device that supplies a varying voltage $V$ or current $I$.

- The sinusoidal voltage is defined as $V = V_m \cos \omega t$, where $\omega$ is the angular frequency, and $V_m$ is the maximum voltage or voltage amplitude.
- The sinusoidal current is defined as $I = I_m \cos \omega t$, where $\omega$ is the angular frequency, and $I_m$ is the maximum current or current amplitude.

The phasor diagram is used to represent varying voltages and currents in ac circuits, where a vector with length $I_m$ is rotating counterclockwise with constant angular speed $\omega$, and the projection of the vector onto the horizontal axis is $I_m \cos \omega t$. The root-mean-square (rms) value represents a value that can be either positive or negative. The root-mean-square value of a phasor $I$ is $I_{\text{rms}} = \frac{I}{\sqrt{2}}$.
