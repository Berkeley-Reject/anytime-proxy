# Electrical Potential

## Electrical Potential Energy

When a force $\vec{F}$ acts on a particle that moves from a point $a$ to point $b$, the work $W_{a \to b}$ is defined as $W_{a \to b} = \int_a^b \vec{F} \cdot d \vec{l} = \int_a^b F \cos \theta dl$. $W_{a \to b}$ can be expressed in terms of a potential energy $U$, where $W_{a \to b} = U_a - U_b = - \Delta U$. The work-energy theorem states that $\Delta K = - \Delta U$, thus $K_a + U_a = K_b + U_b$.

Electric potential energy is a measure of the work that must be done to move a charged particle within the field. When a particle moves from point $a$ to point $b$, the work done on it is $W_{a \to b} = U_a - U_b$.

$U$ increases if the test charge $q_0$ moves in the direction opposite the electric force. In most cases, the point at an infinite distance is a reference point, where $U = 0$.

- Let $\vec{E}$ be a uniform electric field. The field exerts a force with magnitude $F = q_0 E$ on a positive test charge $q_0$. If the charge moves a distance $d$ on the direction of the electric field, $W_{a \to b} = Fd = q_0 Ed$. Therefore, the electric potential energy $U$ is $q_0 E d$, where $d$ is the displacement from a reference point.

- Let $\vec{E}$ be a electric field caused by a single point charge $q$. The field exerts a force with magnitude $F = q_0 E$ on a positive test charge $q_0$. Therefore, the electric potential energy $U$ is $\frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q q_0}{r}$, where $r$ is the distance between the charges.

## Voltage

The electric potential is the electric potential energy per unit charge. The potential $V = \frac{U}{q_0}$ is defined as the potential energy $U$ per unit charge associated with a test charge $q_0$. The unit of electric potential is **volt** or $V$, where $1 V = 1 \frac{J}{C}$.

$V_{ab}$, the potential of $a$ with respect to $b$ equals the work done by the electric field when a unit ($1C$) charge moves from $a$ to $b$.

- The electric potential $V$ due to a point charge is defined as $V = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{r}$.
- The electric potential $V$ due to a collection of point charges is defined as $V = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \sum_i \frac{q_i}{r_i}$.
- The electric potential difference is defined as $V_a - V_b = \int_a^b \vec{E} \cdot d \vec{l} = \int_a^b E \cos \theta dl$.
