# Electric Field and Force

## Electric Charge

Electric charge is a fundamental attribute of matter that determines how it interacts with electric fields. There are two types of electric charge, positive and negative, and like charges repel while opposite charges attract. Electric charges can be transferred between objects through various processes, such as friction, contact, or induction.

The unit of electric charge is the **coulomb** or $C$. The elementary charge is $e = 1.6 \times 10^{-19} C$. The total charge $Q$ on an object is defined as $Q = ne$, where $n$ is the number of elementary charges.

## Electric Field

Electric fields are created by electric charges and can be thought of as the force per unit charge experienced by a charged object in the field. The direction of the electric field is the direction in which a positive test charge would accelerate if placed at a specific point.

- The electric field due to a point charge $Q$ located a distance $r$ is $E = \frac{kQ}{r^2}$, where $k = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0}$ is Coulomb's constant.
- The electric field due to a sphere of radius $R$ and total charge $Q$ located a distance $r$ is $E = \frac{kQr}{R^2}$, $r > R$.
- The electric field due to an infinite line of charge with charge density $\lambda$ located a distance $r$ is $E = \frac{2k \lambda}{r}$.
- The electric field due to an infinite plane of charge with surface charge density $\sigma$ located a distance $r$ is $E = \frac{\sigma}{2\epsilon_0}$, where $\epsilon_0$ is the permittivity of free space.

The electric field exerts a force $\vec{F}$ on a charge that is present in the field. The formula of $\vec{F}$ is $\vec{F} = q \vec{E}$.

## Gauss's Law

The electric flux $\phi$ is a measure of the strength of an electric field passing through a surface. Let $d \phi$ be the magnetic flux of a fraction of the surface, where $d \phi = B \cos \theta dA = \vec{E} \cdot d \vec{A}$. The total magnetic flux through the surface is $\phi = \int E \cos \theta dA = \int \vec{E} \cdot d \vec{A}$.

The Gauss's law states that the electric flux $\phi$ through a closed surface is proportional to the net charge $Q$ enclosed within that surface, where $\phi = \frac{Q}{\epsilon_0}$
