# Scrum

## What is Scrum?

Scrum is a framework that helps teams work together. While it is most frequently used by software development teams, its principles and lessons can be applied to all kinds of teamwork.

## Sprints

A sprint is a short, time-boxed period when a scrum team works to complete a set amount of work. Sprints help teams follow the agile principle of "delivering working software frequently," as well as live the agile value of "responding to change over following a plan."

### How to plan and execute scrum sprints

Sprint planning is a collaborative event where the team answers two basic questions: What work can get done in this sprint and how will the chosen work get done?

- The product owner discusses the objective that the sprint should achieve and the product backlog items that, upon completion, would achieve the sprint goal.
- The team then creates a plan for how they will build the backlog items and get them done before the end of the sprint.
- During a sprint, the team checks in during the daily scrum, or standup, about how the work is progressing.
- After a sprint, the team demonstrates what they’ve completed during the sprint review and rounds out the sprint cycle with the sprint retrospective.

### Do's and Don'’'ts

- Make sure the team sets and understands the sprint goal and how success will be measured.
- Leave out work where you won’t be able to get the dependencies done.
- Ensure you have a good understanding of velocity, and that it reflects things like leave and team meetings.
- Do ensure you have a well-groomed backlog with your priorities and dependencies in order.
- Do use the Sprint Planning meeting to flesh out intimate details of the work that needs to get done.
- Don't pull in too many stories, overestimate velocity, or pull in tasks that can’t be completed in the sprint.
- Don't forget about quality or technical debt. Make sure to budget time for QA and non-feature work, like bugs and engineering health.
- Don't let the team have a fuzzy view of what's in the sprint.
- Don't take on a large amount of unknown or high-risk work.
