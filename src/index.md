# About Me

I'm an undergraduate student at UCLA and I will join [Hudson River Trading](https://www.hudsonrivertrading.com) as an algorithm engineer in August 2024. I'm interested in modern art, classic rock, and options trading.

I have experience in maintaining open-source projects with C++ and Rust. As of 2024, I'm contributing to `libc++`, focusing on improving the source code and implementing C++23 features. This website is a personal knowledge base, containing notes on WG21 (The C++ Standards Committee) papers, Rust RFCs, and quantitative finance.
