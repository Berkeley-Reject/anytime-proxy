# About Me

Hi! I'm Xiaoyang. I graduated from UCLA in 2024 and recently started working at Hudson River Trading.

I have experience maintaining open-source projects using C++ and Rust. As of 2024, I'm contributing to libc++, focusing on improving the source code and implementing features from C++23 and C++26. This website serves as a knowledge base, containing notes on WG21 (the C++ Standards Committee) papers, Rust RFCs, and quantitative finance.
