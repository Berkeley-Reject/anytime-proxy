# N4775: Working Draft, C++ Extensions for Coroutines

## Introduction

A coroutine is a generalization of a function that allows the function to be suspended and then later resumed. The activation frame of a coroutine is divided into a coroutine frame and a stack frame. The stack frame, as in a normal function, can hold the variables whose lifetime doesn't span a coroutine suspend-point. The coroutine frame, allocated on the heap, can hold the registers and variables that persist while the coroutine is suspended.

When the coroutine is invoked, it allocates a coroutine frame and moves the parameters from the stack frame into the coroutine frame so that the parameters live longer than the first suspend point. When the coroutine returns, it stores the return value and destructs in-scope local variables.

The suspend operation suspends execution of the coroutine at the current point within the function and transfers execution back to the caller or resumer without destroying the activation frame. The resume operation resumes the execution of a suspended coroutine at the point at which it was suspended. The destroy operation destroys the activation frame without resuming the execution of the coroutine.

## `co_await`

`co_await` is an operator that allows a coroutine to suspend itself and schedule to be resumed. It must be used in the context of a coroutine. A type that supports the `co_await` operator is an `awaitable` type. A type that implements `await_ready`, `await_suspend`, and `await_resume` is an `awaiter` type.

The compiler generates code to obtain the `awaiter` object from `<expr>`. Assume that the promise object for the awaiting coroutine has type `P` and the `promise` is an lvalue reference to the promise object for the coroutine. If `P` has a member named `await_transform`, then `<expr>` is first passed into a call to `promise.await_transform(<expr>)` to obtain the `awaitable` value. Otherwise, the generated code evaluates `<expr>` to obtain the `awaitable` value. If the `awaitable` has an applicable `operator co_await()` overload, then the generated code calls it to obtain the `awaiter` object. Otherwise, the `awaitable` value is used as the `awaiter` object.

```cpp
template <typename P, typename T>
decltype(auto) get_awaitable(P &promise, T &&expr) {
  if constexpr (has_await_transform_member<P>) {
    return promise.await_transform(std::forward<T>(expr));
  } else {
    return std::forward<T>(expr);
  }
}

template <typename A> decltype(auto) get_awaiter(A &&awaitable) {
  if constexpr (has_member_operator_co_await<A>) {
    return std::forward<A>(awaitable).operator co_await();
  } else if constexpr (has_non_member_operator_co_await<A>) {
    return operator co_await(std::forward<A>(awaitable));
  } else {
    return std::forward<A>(awaitable);
  }
}

auto &&value = <expr>;
auto &&awaitable = get_awaitable(promise, std::forward<decltype(value)>(value));
auto &&awaiter = get_awaiter(std::forward<decltype(awaitable)>(awaitable));
```

After obtaining the `awaiter` object, the generated code invokes its `await_ready()` method. If it returns `false`, the generated code suspends the coroutine and invokes the `awaiter` object's `await_suspend()` method. If it returns `void` or `true`, the coroutine transfers execution back to the caller or resumer of the coroutine. If it returns `false`, it behaves as if scheduling the coroutine for immediate resumption on the current thread.

The `await_suspend()` method should schedule the coroutine for resumption or destruction at some point in the future once the operation has been completed. When the suspended coroutine is resumed, the generated code invokes its `await_resume()` method. Its return value becomes the result of the `co_await <expr>` expression.

```cpp
if (!awaiter.await_ready()) {
  // <suspend-coroutine>

  using handle_t = std::coroutine_handle<P>::from_promise(p);
  using result_t = decltype(awaiter.await_suspend(std::declval<handle_t>()));
  if constexpr (std::same_as<result_t, void>) {
    awaiter.await_suspend(handle_t::from_promise(p));
    // <return-to-caller-or-resumer>
  }
  if constexpr (std::same_as<result_t, bool>) {
    if (awaiter.await_suspend(handle_t::from_promise(p))) {
      // <return-to-caller-or-resumer>
    }
  }

  // <resume-point>
}

return awaiter.await_resume();
```

One advantage of this design is that the coroutine is guaranteed to be suspended when the generated code invokes `await_suspend()`. Otherwise, if the `awaiter` schedules the coroutine to be resumed in another thread, that thread might resume it when it hasn't been suspended.

However, once the coroutine is scheduled to be resumed in another thread, that thread might resume it before `await_suspend()` returns. The coroutine could then run to completion, destructing the coroutine and promise object, all before `await_suspend()` returns. Therefore, within the `await_suspend()` method, once it's possible for the coroutine to be resumed on another thread, accessing `this` or the coroutine's promise object might be undefined behavior.

## Coroutine Handle

The `std::coroutine_handle<P>` type represents a non-owning handle to the coroutine frame and can be used to resume execution of the coroutine or get access to the coroutine's promise object.

- The `resume()` method resumes a suspended coroutine at `<resume-point>` and the call will return when the coroutine hits a `<return-to-caller-or-resumer>` point.
- The `destroy()` method calls the destructors of all in-scope variables and deallocates the coroutine frame.
- The `promise()` method returns a reference to the coroutine's promise object.
- The `address()` method converts a coroutine handle to a `void*` pointer that can be passed as a parameter into existing C PAIs.
