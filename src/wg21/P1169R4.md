# P1169R4: static `operator()`

[P1169R4](https://wg21.link/P1169R4) is a proposal for C++23 that allows `operator()` to be `static`. The motivation is that several functions are implemented as function objects in `std`, including the customization point objects introduced in [P0896R4: The One Ranges Proposal](https://wg21.link/P0896R4), such as `std::ranges::size`. Although these function objects are stateless, their call operators are non-static member functions. Therefore, if the call operator happens to not be inlined, an extra register must be used to pass in the `this` pointer to the object, even if there is no need for it.

```diff
struct equal_to {
  template <typename T, typename U>
    requires std::equality_comparable_with<T, U>
- [[nodiscard]] constexpr bool operator()(T &&t, U &&u) const {
+ [[nodiscard]] static constexpr bool operator()(T &&t, U &&u) {
    return std::forward<T>(t) == std::forward<U>(u);
  }
};
```

Lambda without captures is a common function object whose call operator could be `static`. This proposal introduces a `static` specifier for lambda expressions, which will cause the call operator of the lambda to be a `static` member function. Such lambda expressions must not have captures or declared as `mutable`.

```cpp
auto predicate = []<typename A, typename B>
  requires std::equality_comparable_with<A, B>
(const A &a, const B &b) constexpr static noexcept -> bool { return a == b; };

// `predicate` will desugar into `predicate_t`
class predicate_t {
public:
  template <typename A, typename B>
    requires std::equality_comparable_with<A, B>
  constexpr static auto operator()(const A &a, const B &b) noexcept -> bool {
    return a == b;
  }
};
```

Furthermore, the deduction guide of `std::function`and `std::packaged_task` should be improved to handle the case when the call operator is a `static` member function.

```cpp
std::function predicate = [](const std::uint8_t a, const std::uint8_t b
                          ) constexpr static noexcept -> bool {
  return a == b;
};
```
