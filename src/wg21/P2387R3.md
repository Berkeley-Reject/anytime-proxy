# P2387R3: Pipe support for user-defined range adaptors

[P2387R3](https://wg21.link/P2387R3) is a proposal for C++23 that allows user to define their range adaptors that will inter-operate with `std` adaptors.

## Range Adaptor Closure Object

The range adaptor closure object is a function object that accepts a `range` argument. For a range adaptor closure object `C` and an expression `R` such that `decltype((R))` models `range`, `R | C` is equivalent to `C(R)`. Given an additional range adaptor closure object `D`, the expression `C | D` is well-formed and produces a range adaptor closure object `E`, which is a perfect forwarding call wrapper. Let `c` be an object of type `decay_t<decltype((C))` and `d` be `decay_t<decltype((D))`, the closure object `E` will call `d(c(arg))`, where `arg` is the argument used in a function call expression of `E`.

The `ranges::range_adaptor_closure` CRTP-based class template is an interface that range adaptor closure objects will have to inherit. The derived class `C` needs to provide a call operator `C(R)`, and `ranges::range_adaptor_closure<C>` will provide an `operator|` that handles both `R | C` and `C | D`. The following code snippet is an implementation of `ranges::range_adaptor_closure`:

```cpp
template <typename T> struct range_adaptor_closure;

// Wraps a function object and makes it into a `range_adaptor_closure`
template <typename Fn>
struct range_adaptor_closure_t
    : Fn,
      range_adaptor_closure<range_adaptor_closure_t<Fn>> {
  constexpr explicit range_adaptor_closure_t(Fn &&f) : Fn(std::move(f)) {}
};

template <typename T>
concept RangeAdaptorClosure = std::derived_from<
    std::remove_cvref_t<T>, range_adaptor_closure<std::remove_cvref_t<T>>>;

template <typename T> struct range_adaptor_closure {
  // `R | C` is equivalent to `C(R)`
  template <std::ranges::viewable_range View, RangeAdaptorClosure Closure>
    requires std::same_as<T, std::remove_cvref_t<Closure>> &&
             std::invocable<Closure, View>
  [[nodiscard]] friend constexpr decltype(auto) operator|(
      View &&view, Closure &&closure
  ) noexcept(std::is_nothrow_invocable_v<Closure, View>) {
    return std::invoke(
        std::forward<Closure>(closure), std::forward<View>(view)
    );
  }

  // `C | D` is well-formed and produces a `range_adaptor_closure` object `E`
  template <RangeAdaptorClosure Closure, RangeAdaptorClosure OtherClosure>
    requires std::same_as<T, std::remove_cvref_t<Closure>> &&
             std::constructible_from<std::decay_t<Closure>, Closure> &&
             std::constructible_from<std::decay_t<OtherClosure>, OtherClosure>
  [[nodiscard]] friend constexpr auto operator|(
      Closure &&__c1, OtherClosure &&__c2
  ) noexcept(std::is_nothrow_constructible_v<std::decay_t<Closure>, Closure> && std::is_nothrow_constructible_v<std::decay_t<OtherClosure>, OtherClosure>) {
    return range_adaptor_closure_t(std::__compose(
        std::forward<OtherClosure>(__c2), std::forward<Closure>(__c1)
    ));
  }
};
```

## Range Adaptor Object

Range adaptor object is a customization point object that accepts `viewable_range` as its first argument and returns a `view`. For a range adaptor `A` and an expression `R` such that `decltype((R))` models `viewable_range`, `A(R, args...)`, `A(args...)(R)`, and `R | A(args...)` are equivalent, where `A(args...)` produces a range adaptor closure object.

As described in the proposal, different `std` implementations have various strategies to support these operations. For example, the range adaptor objects can define an explicit `operator(args...)` that returns a range adaptor closure object. The following code snippet is an implementation of `views::take` that handles the case when the first argument is an `empty_view`:

```cpp
template <typename T> inline constexpr bool is_empty_view = false;
template <typename T>
inline constexpr bool is_empty_view<std::ranges::empty_view<T>> = true;

struct take_fn {
  // `A(R, args...)`
  template <
      typename Range,
      std::convertible_to<std::ranges::range_difference_t<Range>> N>
    requires is_empty_view<Range>
  [[nodiscard]] static constexpr auto operator()(Range &&range, N &&) noexcept(
      noexcept(auto(std::forward<Range>(range)))
  ) -> decltype(auto(std::forward<Range>(range))) {
    return auto(std::forward<Range>(range));
  }

  // `A(args...)(R)` and `R | A(args...)`
  template <typename N>
    requires std::constructible_from<std::decay_t<N>, N>
  [[nodiscard]] constexpr auto operator()(N &&n) const
      noexcept(std::is_nothrow_constructible_v<std::decay_t<N>, N>) {
    // `A(args...)` returns a range adaptor closure object
    return range_adaptor_closure_t(std::bind_back(*this, std::forward<N>(n)));
  }
};

inline constexpr auto take = take_fn{};
```

## Implementation

### NanoRange

- The `operator|(R, C)` is defined in the `nano::detail` namespace, which returns `C(R)`.
- The `operator|(C, D)` is defined in the `nano::detail` namespace, which returns a range adaptor closure object `raco_pipe` that holds both `C` and `D`. It provides the `operator()(R)` that returns `D(C(R))`.
- To implement a range adaptor closure object, such as `join`, the user should define it in the `nano::detail` namespace and provide the `operator(R)`. (Otherwise, the compiler can't find `operator|(R, C)` and `operator|(C, D)`.)
- To implement a range adaptor object, such as `transform`, the user should provide the `operator(args...)`, which returns a range closure adaptor object, and the `operator(R, args...)`.

### range-v3

- The `operator|(R, C)` is defined in the `view_closure_base` object, which returns `C(R)`.
- The `operator|(C, D)` is defined in the `view_closure_base` object, which returns a range adaptor closure object `view_closure` that holds a composed function `|R| D(C(R))`.
- To implement a range adaptor closure object, such as `join`, the user should provide the `operator(R)` and wrap it in `view_closure`. (The `view_closure` object inherits from `view_closure_base`, so the compiler can find `operator|(R, C)` and `operator|(C, D)`.)
- To implement a range adaptor object, such as `transform`, the user should provide `operator(args...)`, which returns a `view_closure`, and `operator(R, args...)`.

The difference with `NanoRange` is that `operator|(R, C)` and `operator|(C, D)` are defined in `view_closure_base`, which is the base class of all range adaptor closure objects. Because `operator|(R, C)` and `operator|(C, D)` are friend functions, inheriting from `view_closure_base` enables ADL and allows the template to determine if a particular type is a range adaptor closure object.

### libstdc++ 10

- The `operator|(R, C)` is defined in the `_RangeAdaptorClosure` object, which returns `C(R)`.
- The `operator|(C, D)` is defined in the `_RangeAdaptorClosure` object, which returns a `_RangeAdaptorClosure` object that holds a composed function `|R| D(C(R))`.
- The `operator(R, args...)` is defined in the `_RangeAdaptor` object, which returns a `_RangeAdaptorClosure`.
- To implement a range adaptor closure object, such as `join`, the user should provide `operator(R)` and wrap it in `_RangeAdaptorClosure`.
- To implement a range adaptor object, such as `transform`, the user should provide `operator(R, args...)` and wrap it in `_RangeAdaptor`.

The difference with `NanoRange` and `range-v3` is that `operator(R, args...)` is defined in `_RangeAdaptor`, which is the base class of all range adaptor objects. It means that the user won't need to provide it.

### libstdc++ 11

- The `operator|(R, C)` is defined in the `_RangeAdaptorClosure` object, which returns `C(R)`.
- The `operator|(C, D)` is defined in the `_RangeAdaptorClosure` object, which returns a `_RangeAdaptorClosure` object that holds a composed function `|R| D(C(R))`.
- The `operator(R, args...)` is defined in the `_RangeAdaptor` object, which is a CRTP template.
- To implement a range adaptor closure object, such as `join`, the user should provide `operator(R)` and inherit from `_RangeAdaptorClosure`.
- To implement a range adaptor object, such as `transform`, the user should provide `operator(R, args...)` and inherit from `_RangeAdaptor`.

The difference with `GCC 10` is that the `_RangeAdaptor` no longer stores the callable function in the object. Instead, it expects the callable function to be provided through inheritance from the `_RangeAdaptor` class itself. This is achieved through the CRTP pattern, where `_RangeAdaptor` is a template that expects the derived class to provide the `operator(R, args...)` member function. Because `operator(args...)` is a member function of `_RangeAdaptor`, the `CRTP` approach allows it to deduce the type of object on which this function is invoked.

The friend functions `operator|(R, C)` and `operator|(C, D)` are defined in the `_RangeAdaptorClosure` base class. Inheriting from this base class, range adaptor closure objects enable ADL and allow the template to determine if a particular type is a range adaptor closure object.

### libc++

- The `operator|(R, C)` is defined in the `__range_adaptor_closure` object, which is a CRTP template, and returns `C(R)`.
- The `operator|(C, D)` is defined in the `__range_adaptor_closure` object, which is a CRTP template, and returns a `__range_adaptor_closure` object that holds a composed function `|R| D(C(R))`.
- To implement a range adaptor closure object, such as `join`, the user should provide the `operator(R)` and inherit from `__range_adaptor_closure`.
- To implement a range adaptor object, such as `transform`, the user should provide `operator(args...)`, which returns a `__range_adaptor_closure_t`, and `operator(R, args...)`.

The difference with `libstd++ 11` is that `__range_adaptor_closure` is a CRTP template, so it can constrain `operator|(R, C)` and `operator|(C, D)` such that the type `C` must be the same as the type of the inherited function object. This approach provides a clearer diagnostic when there is a mismatch between the expected and actual types involved in the range adaptor closure.
