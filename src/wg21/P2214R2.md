# P2214R2: A Plan for C++23 Ranges

[P2214R2](https://wg21.link/P2214R2) is a proposal for C++23 that prioritizes features missing from [P0896R4](https://wg21.link/P0896R4), which was knowingly incomplete.

## View Adjuncts

One critical missing piece of functionality is `ranges::to`. While not a view, it is often used as the terminal component of a view pipeline to create a new trailing range and collect the results of the computation being constructed.

Another critical piece of functionality is that it is currently impossible for users to write their own range adaptors such that they smoothly interact with standard library (or other user-defined) range adaptors. To enable this, the standard library needs to provide pipe support for user-defined adaptors. If users can define more adaptors, it becomes less critical for the standard library to provide all of them.

An additional important feature is the ability to print views. Therefore, it is important that C++23 provides the ability to format all ranges.

## Algorithms

The largest contribution of C++20 Ranges was the algorithms, and the work in this area has been thorough. However, the algorithms in `<numeric>` do not yet have range-based versions.

### Algorithms that Output a Value

- `std::accumulate`: The author argues that having a range-based left-fold algorithm in the standard library is very important, as it is a fundamental algorithm. The proposed name is `ranges::fold`, as `std::accumulate` favors addition, which may limit its usage in other scenarios. The binary predicate should not have a default value and should accept heterogeneous types as parameters.
- `std::reduce`: The author suggests that this algorithm's binary predicate, being associative and commutative, requires adopting a complex set of constraints.
- `std::inner_product` and `std::transform_reduce`: These algorithms are considered less fundamental, as they can be replaced by a composition of `ranges::fold` and `views::zip_transform`.

### Algorithms that Output a Range

- `std::iota`: The author believes this algorithm is trivial to adopt since `views::iota` was adopted in C++20, ensuring all the correct constraints are in place.
- `std::shift_left` and `std::shift_right`: The return type of `std::ranges::shift_left` remains unclear.
- `std::adjacent_difference`: This algorithm can be replaced by composing `views::adjacent_transform` and `ranges::copy`, so its adoption priority can be lowered.
- `std::partial_sum`, `std::inclusive_scan`, and `std::exclusive_scan`: Similar to `std::adjacent_difference`, their adoption priority can be lowered as their inclusion remains a question to be resolved.
- `std::transform_inclusive_scan` and `std::transform_exclusive_scan`: These algorithms can be replaced by composing `views::transform` with `ranges::inclusive_scan` or `ranges::exclusive_scan`.

### Parallel Algorithms

One of the key additions in C++17 was the introduction of parallel algorithms. The author suggests that, with ongoing work on `std::execution`, it is important to ensure that parallel overloads for constrained algorithms are compatible with `std::execution`. However, due to the executor dependency and the complexity of specifying parallel requirements, their adoption priority can be lowered.

## Actions

There are three kinds of operations in `range-v3`:

- **Algorithms**: Eagerly perform operations that mutate an input range, produce a value, both, or create a new range via an output iterator or output range.
- **Views**: Lazily produce a new range.
- **Actions**: Eagerly produce a new range.

The advantage of actions is that, unlike algorithms, they compose; and unlike views, they can take rvalue ranges. However, the author believes this area requires more research. Since actions do not provide any functionality that existing ranges and views do not already offer, their adoption priority can be lowered.
